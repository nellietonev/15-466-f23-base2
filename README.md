# The Bee Move-E

Author: Nellie Tonev

Design: Have you ever watched the fascinating process of a beekeeper relocating a bee colony and their hive and wished 
that you could try it out yourself (without the risk of getting stung, of course)?
Well, now you can (in an extremely simplified and low-poly way)!

Base game with no shader (current executable game appearance):

I also began playing around with some shader modifications (commented out [here](LitColorTextureProgram.cpp)) and got
the game to look like this:

How To Play:
* Press 'E' to move piece of honeycomb from the watering can to the target box.
* Press 'Q' to quit the game.

Thanks for playing :)
